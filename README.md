## Broken Physical Models ##

SuperCollider plugins created by applying the techniques of bitbending (the digital variant of circuit bending) to physical models.

The only one right now is GlitchPiano, derived from OteyPianoStrings.

## Installation

OS X and Linux:

    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake -DSC_PATH="/path/to/supercollider/source/" ..
    make

Then install the directory as you would a quark. (You can copy/move/symlink it in your Extensions directory, or go to `Quarks.gui` > Install a folder.)

If you know how to build on Windows, please let me know.
